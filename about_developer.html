    <h3 id="favorite_quote">Man surprised me most about humanity. Because he sacrifices</br>
    his health in order to make money. Then he sacrafices money to<br/>
  recuperate his health. And then is so anxious about the future that he<br/>
does not enjoy the present, the result being that he does not live in the<br/>
present or the future. He lives as if he is never going to die, and then<br/>
dies having never really lived.<br/>
